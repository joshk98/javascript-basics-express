# Express API for JavaScript Basics

This is an Express API that provides functionality for basic JavaScript concepts such as arrays, booleans, numbers, objects, and strings. The API has been developed to work with the previously written javascript-basics code.

## Getting started

Make sure you have Visual Studio Code installed and updated to the latest version. Also, ensure that you have the ESLint extension installed and enabled.

## Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder:

```bash

git clone git@github.com:MCRcodes/javascript-basics-express.git
cd javascript-basics-express

```

## Install the dependencies:

```bash

npm install

```

## Copy over your JavaScript Basics code

```css
src
├── app.js
└── lib
    ├── arrays.js
    ├── booleans.js
    ├── numbers.js
    ├── objects.js
    └── strings.js
```

## Running tests

You can run tests with the command:

```bash

npm test

```
